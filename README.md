# README for "Fertility Rate and Women's Education: A Decades-Long Analysis"

## Description

Welcome to the Fertility and Women's Education: A Decades-Long Analysis" dashboard. This interactive tool, developed in `Python`, provides a comprehensive exploration of the relationship between women's fertility trends and educational attainment over a span of centuries.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of four main pages:

1.  Trends in Fertility Rates (1800 - 2023)

This page visualizes global total fertility trends over two centuries,
highlighting key metrics for the year 2023, including the current world
population size, the number of births, and the total fertility rate. It
also presents projections for the world population size in 2050. A
dynamic world map illustrates the changes in total fertility rates over
time. A bar chart showcases the top 10 countries globally and by
continent, ranked by fertility rate.

2.  Education Trends (1970 - 2015)

This section focuses on education trends for women, featuring data on
global literacy rates in 2022 and female completion rates for primary,
lower secondary, and upper secondary education in 2023. Another dynamic
world map displays the trends in female mean years of schooling over
time, alongside a bar chart displaying the top 10 countries or
continents based on female mean years in school.

3.  Scatter Plot Analysis

The third page presents a dynamic scatter plot that correlates female
mean years in school with total fertility rates, allowing for an
in-depth analysis of the relationship between education and fertility.

4.  Data Access

Users can download the main datasets used in the dashboard from this
final page, ensuring transparency and the ability for further
exploration and analysis.

## Data Sources

This dashboard integrates data from these sources to ensure accuracy and
reliability:

1\. 2023 World Population Data Sheet:
`Population Reference Bureau [https://www.prb.org/international/indicator/]`

2\. Gapminder: `[https://www.gapminder.org/data/]`

3\. UNESCO: `[https://data.uis.unesco.org/]`

## Usage

To navigate the dashboard:

-   Use the dynamic world maps to explore changes in fertility and
    education over time across different regions.
-   View bar charts to easily compare fertility rates and educational
    attainment across various countries.
-   Analyze the scatter plot to identify patterns and correlations
    between women's education and fertility.
-   For further research, download the underlying datasets from the last
    page.

## Conclusion 

This dashboard represents the culmination of my learning experience in
the [Python Basics & Beyond](https://thegraphcourses.org/pbb/) course organized by the GRAPH Network. I would like to
sincerely thank my trainers for their invaluable guidance, support, and
expertise throughout this journey. Their insights have helped deepen my
understanding of data analysis and visualization, enabling me to
successfully complete this project.
